# Quantum-Inspired Adaptive Jump Search (QIAJS)

**Exploring a Novel Algorithm for Enhanced Search Speed and Efficiency**

## Overview

QIAJS is a conceptual search algorithm that blends quantum-inspired principles, machine learning, and hybrid data structures to potentially outperform traditional algorithms. This repository invites collaboration for testing, refining, and advancing its innovative approach.

**Key Features:**

- **Quantum-Inspired Probing:** Explores multiple potential target areas simultaneously, guided by quantum probability calculations.
- **Machine Learning Adaptation:** Dynamically adjusts jump sizes and probabilities based on search patterns and data characteristics.
- **Hybrid Data Structure:** Combines BST and hash table for efficient access and updates.

## Usage

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mohamedsakeel/QIAJS.git`
2. Install dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

**Code Examples:**

```python
# Example usage (Python)
import qiajs

data = [10, 4, 25, 7, 15]  # Sample data
target = 7

index = qiajs.search(data, target)
if index is not None:
    print("Target found at index:", index)
else:
    print("Target not found")
